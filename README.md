## Abstract

This project implements an AI system that learns to create drawings based on user input. Using a combination of neural rendering and deep reinforcement learning, the AI learns to decompose complex visual concepts into a series of strokes and colors. The system can:

- Interpret textual descriptions to generate appropriate drawings
- Learn from user feedback to improve its drawing skills
- Create drawings in various styles based on user preferences
